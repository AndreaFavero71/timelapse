Setting up the Timelapse:
1. Via the Raspberry Pi Imager flash a fast (V30) microSD card with Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit). It is convenient to set a meaningfull Hostname (i.e. timelapse), the Username can remain "pi" but use a personal Password. Configure the LAN from which you're going to initially connect (i.e. via SSH).
2. Into the boot folder copy the wpa_supplicant.conf text file with included the wi-fi connections you might need (phone AP is convenient one); An example of this file if provided as reference, to be personalized with your Country difits, the Wi-Fi SSID and Passwords.
3. Insert the microSD into the Raspberry Pi, power on and wait until the green LED stops blinking.
4. Check for the Raspberry Pi IP in your network.
5. Connect to the raspberry Pi via SSH (i.e. via Putty).
6. Update the system: sudo apt update
7. Upgrade the system: sudo apt upgrade  (confirm with y).
8. Install the picamera library (it should be already installed): sudo apt-get install python3-picamera.
9. Reboot: sudo reboot
10. Connect via VNC (i.e. via realVNC)
11. Set the screen aoording to your preference (Raspberry Pi icon, Preferences Screen configuration)
12. Open the Terminal
13. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AndreaFavero71/timelapse.git


Test
1. The timelapse files are under the timelapse folder: cd timelapse
2. Edit the settinngs.txt file for a couple of minutes shooting, and save it.
3. Run the timelapse script: python3 timelapse.py
4. Check tinto the generated folder at /home/shared/  the captured pictured and the generated timelapse movie.


Making a shared folder via SMB protocol:
1. Install samba: sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin (confirm with y, and yes at DHCP package wins)
2. Make the folder to share: mkdir /home/pi/shared
3. Edit samba config file: sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf    (at the file end add the below 5 rows)
   [shared]
   path=/home/pi/shared
   create mask=0777
   directory folder=07777
   pubblic=no
4. Save and close the samba config file: Ctrl+X then Y then Enter
5. Associate your username: sudo smbpasswd -a pi    (pi is the username)
   once requested enter your password (the one to access the Raspberry Pi)
   once requested enter your password again (the one to access the Raspberry Pi)
   at this point there should be a confirmation "Added user pi."
6. Restart smb service: sudo systemctl restart smbd
7. Get the Raspberry Pi IP: hostname -I  (capital I)
8. On your File Explorer Adress bar paste the IP, after the prefix "\\" and followed by the postfix "\shared": \\xx:xx:xx:xx\shared
9. Enter the password, and check it to get memorized.
10. The Raspberry Pi "shared" folder should be visible as a network folder; map it as a drive for convenience.
