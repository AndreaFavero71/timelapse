Setting up the Timelapse:
1. Flash bullseye OS (or newer) in a fast (V30) microSD card, via Raspberry Pi Imager or other imager tool.
1.1 It is convenient to set a meaningfull Hostname (i.e. timelapse).
1.2 For convenience with the script, leave Username as "pi", while you're invited to set your own password (do not use the raspberry as password).
1.3 Configure the LAN from which you're going to initially connect (i.e. via SSH).
2. Into the boot folder copy the wpa_supplicant.conf text file with included the wi-fi connections you might need (phone AP is convenient one); An example of this file if provided as reference, to be personalized with your Country difits, the Wi-Fi SSID and Passwords.
3. Insert the microSD into the Raspberry Pi, power on and wait until the green LED stops blinking.
4. Check for the Raspberry Pi IP in your network.
5. Connect to the raspberry Pi via SSH (i.e. via Putty).
6. Update the system: sudo apt update
7. Upgrade the system: sudo apt upgrade -y
8. Install the picamera library (it should be already installed): sudo apt install python3-picamera2
9. Install the driver for the display: pip3 install ST7789==0.0.4
10. Enable the SSH, SPI, VNC and VNC Display resolution: sudo raspi-config
10.1 Select: Interface Options
10.2 Select: SSH   (then YES)
10.3 Select: Interface Options
10.4 Select: SPI   (then YES)
10.5 Select: Interface Options
10.6 Select: VNC   (then YES)
10.7 Select: Display Options
10.8 Select: VNC Resolution (choose the one tha better suit your PC monitor, then OK)
10.9 Select: Finish
10.10. Confirm the reboot with YES (if you miss it, from the terminal type: sudo reboot)
11. Connect via VNC (i.e. via realVNC)
12. Open the Terminal
13. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AndreaFavero71/timelapse.git


Making a shared folder via SMB protocol:
1. Install samba: sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin (confirm with y, and yes at DHCP package wins)
2. Make the folder to share: mkdir /home/pi/shared
3. Edit samba config file: sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf    (at the file end add the below 6 rows, Ctrl + Ins to paste)
[shared]
path=/home/pi/shared
writeable=yes
create mask=0777
directory folder=07777
pubblic=no
4. Save and close the samba config file: Ctrl+X then Y then Enter
5. Associate your username: sudo smbpasswd -a pi    (pi is the username)
   once requested enter your password (the one to access the Raspberry Pi)
   once requested enter your password again (the one to access the Raspberry Pi)
   at this point there should be a confirmation "Added user pi."
6. Restart smb service: sudo systemctl restart smbd
7. Get the Raspberry Pi IP: hostname -I  (capital I)
8. On your File Explorer Adress bar paste the IP, after the prefix "\\" and followed by the postfix "\shared": \\xx:xx:xx:xx\shared
9. Enter the password, and check it to get memorized.
10. The Raspberry Pi "shared" folder should be visible as a network folder; map it as a drive for convenience.


Test / usage
1. The timelapse files are under 'timelapse' folder: cd timelapse
2. Edit the settinngs.txt file for a couple of minutes shooting, and save it: nano settings.txt  (Ctrl + X  then Y  then Enter)
3. Run the timelapse script: python3 timelapse.py
4. If the preview is enabled, an additional windows opens with the Picamera preview live streaming.
5. Check into the generated folder at /home/shared/  for the captured pictured and the generated timelapse movie.
